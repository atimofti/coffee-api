# The Caffeine Manager

Monitoring application for coffee intake written in Python using the FastAPI
framework and SQLAlchemy.
Code was validated using the `pylint` and `pydocstyle` linters as part of the
`pre-commit` pipeline which was ran locally. Future iterations can have this
pipeline added as CI using GitHub actions.
